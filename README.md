### new things i learned
- this is my first full stack app - i used database for the first time, and used apis to link it
- typescript + nextjs!
- learned to use shadcn ui - and wished i discovered it earlier
- used convex and clerk and absolutely loved the combo!
- how to real time collaboration with liveblocks
- how routing works so perfectly in nextjs (i love it)
- layers and canvas drawing components


### challenges i faced
- even though clerk and convex combo is supposed to be easy for beginners to set up an authentication system and backend with db, i had lots of trouble setting up and understanding how schema works, apis, setting up the authenatication system and wrapping teh whole application in it.
- understanding conevx functions and making sure the code is good enough for boards and schema.
- even though using shadcn ui was supposed to speed up the process, it took me equally long setting up the backend and db.
- setting up schema and the whole db thingy - even though i did not do much actual coding for these, it was still kinda hard to wrap my head around.
- debugging typescript issues. now i understand why ts is used for safety.
- reading documentation for new libraries - i never put this much time reading documentations over and over again before


### future ideas
- def adding more canvas components (shapes, text, notes, pencil tool)
- improving the UI (sob)
- making it so that user does not have to authenticate first thing to see the app (ik it's annoying)
- more...
